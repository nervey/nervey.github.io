# Poor but never give up faith.
# Everyone has a dream.
# I have a dream that I have my own company making fabulous products that everyone in the world can enjoy.

# powerful relatives working in government office. Neither rich family. I am on my own.
# Life's unfair and I do not choose to adapt to it.
# I respect those adventurous inventors, scientists, philosophers, entrepreneurs who contribute
# so much to human civilization.

# I want be the witness of flying cars.
# Spirit is the thing lasting forever.
# Get involoved. That's the meaning of life.
